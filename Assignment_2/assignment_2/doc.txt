They wil say
we came to you to stop the bloodshed
we came to you, o’ prince, to medaite.
They will say
‘Here we are cousins’
so tell them
they had no such considration
for he who has perished.
Instill the sword into the forehead of the dessert
until the nothingness tells you
that I was for you
a knight
a brother
a father
and a king
